## What is ATE?

...is it a [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database?  
...is it a [distributed redo log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redo_log)?  
...is it a [event BUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)?  
...is it a [distributed queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue)?  
...is it a [distributed cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cache)?  
...is it a secure encrypted vault?  
...is it a [quantum resistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Post-Quantum_Cryptography_Competition) communication framework?  
...is it a [WORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once_read_many) archive solution?  
    
ATE is all these things and none of them; it is [unique way](doc/design.md) to work with distributed
data that can easily implement all of the above use cases - take a look at the [examples](#examples)
for how you can achieve them.

## Why the name?

The origin of the word "mutate" is the latin word '-ate':  
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mutate

## Summary

ATE is a distributed immutable data store and built in memory based materialized
view with strong encryption and authentication.

What does that mean?

This library is a way of working with data in modern distributed computing.
* ...data is persisted to a distributed commit log.
* ...partitions are divided into chains that shard data into physical domains.
* ...streaming of data to the application occurs on demand during method invocation.
* ...each chain is a crypto-graph with unique asymmetric keys at differentiating nodes.
* ...the root of the chain-of-trust that validates the crypto-graph through various plugins.
* ...strong authentication and authorized is by design built into the data model.
* ...encryption is highly resistant to quantum attacks and uses fine-grained tenant keys.
* ...all this is integrated into a shared-nothing highly portable executable.

## Changelog

```
0.3.0 - New API changes to cater for future releases with many fixes for critical bugs
        + Improvements to the log file format to support forward compatibility
        + Added wire encryption as another layer of defence using perfect-forward-secrecy
        + Modified the hash routines to reduce changes of collisions on key generation
        + Many bug fixes and performance optimizations
0.2.* - Alpha version with API changes
0.1.* - Alpha version with basic functionality and free bugs
```

## Todo

```
1.0.* - First release of a production grade version of ATE with AteFS using
        Tokera as authentication
0.*.* - Estimated 1-month of work before enough bugs are solved and the API
        can be fully stabilised
0.4.* - Will include functionality to execute commands remotely, will include
        the authentication server support using a standardized object model
        and implementation of the command pattern
```

## Quick Start

Add ate, serde and tokio to your dependency list in Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "*", features = ["full", "signal", "process"] }
serde = { version = "*", features = ["derive"] }
ate = "*"
```

Create a main.rs file

```rust
extern crate tokio;
extern crate serde;

use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use ate::prelude::*;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct World
{
    commandment: String
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), AteError>
{
    // The default configuration will store the redo log locally in the temporary folder
    let conf = AteConfig::default();
    let builder = ChainBuilder::new(&conf);

    // We create a chain with a specific key (this is used for the file name it creates)
    let chain = Chain::new(builder, &ChainKey::from("universe")).await?;
    
    // We interact with the data stored in the chain-of-trust using a DIO
    let session = AteSession::default();
    let mut dio = chain.dio(&session).await;
    
    // In this example we store some data in the "World" object
    let key = dio.store(World {
        commandment: "Hello".to_string(),
    })?.key().clone();
    dio.commit().await?;
    
    // Now we retreive the data and print it to console
    println!("{} world!", dio.load::<World>(&key).await?.commandment);

    // All errors in ATE will convert into the AteError
    Ok(())
}
```
